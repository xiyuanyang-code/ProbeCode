## Problems to be solved

The problem is: {problem}

### Attention! You can write code to help you solve the problem

Solve the problem with the help of feedback from a code executor. Every time you write a piece of code between <code> and </code>, the code inside will be executed. For example, when encounting numerical operations, you might write a piece of code to inteprete the math problem into python code and print the final result in the code. Based on the reasoning process and the executor feedback, you could write code to help answering the question for multiple times (either for gaining new information or verifying). There are also several integrated tools that can be used to help you solve the problem. 

## Other available tools
